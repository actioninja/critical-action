# License

All website code is licensed under [MPL v2.0](../LICENSE.md). This means anything in JS, CSS, or Typescript files, as well as their
configs.

In simple terms, you can use these files in any projects including with modifications, but the files must remain
licensed under MPL 2.0, including modification. This isn't legally binding the license text itself is, see
[LICENSE.md.](../LICENSE.md) There's even a nifty little popup from GitHub that makes the terms clearer.

All content, anything in MDX files or within `static` or `content` is licensed under
[CC-BY-NC-SA v4.0](../content/LICENSE.md). This is, of course, unless otherwise indicated, in the case that I'm using
something else such as an image or quotation with proper permission/citation. You can share, redistrubute, remix, edit,
reformat, adapt, or whatever for any of my content as long as:

1. You credit me as the original creator
2. It's noncommercial - you can't make money from it
3. It's *also* licensed under CC-BY-NC-SA v4.0

Again, this is not a substitute for the license, not legally binding, see the license text itself for the legally
binding part.

If on the off chance you want a usage that doesn't meet these terms, contact me at
[actioninja@criticalaction.net](mailto:actioninja@criticalaction.net)
and we can likely work something out.
